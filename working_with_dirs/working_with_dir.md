# üêß Linux Directory Commands Bash Script
I have created a simple bash script, where i have practiced simple but very useful commands that is helpful for handling directories.

## üõ†Ô∏è Commands that i have covered in this script
* `mkdir`
* `mv`
* `cd`
* `rm`
* `rmdir`
* `cp`

**üîçI have also covered flags associated with commands. I have shown all the flags and it's uses below in the table**

| Command  | flag|Description                             |
|----------|-----|----------------------------------------|
| `rm`     | -r  |deletes directory and it's content      |
| `rm`     | -ri |deletes directory and it's content with permission           |
| `cp`     | -i  |copy and overwrite the file to destination with permission        |
| `cp`     | -n  |does not overwrite the file                 |
| `cp`     | -u  |overwrites the file if the content of the file is different            |
| `cp`     | -R  |Recursive copy, copies hidden files also |
| `cp `    | -V  | shows the informative messages while copying |
