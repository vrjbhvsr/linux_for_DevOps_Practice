# Service management

**In this section I will explore:**
1. Understanding Linux Services
2. Systemd Basics
3. ervice Management using systemctl
4. Logs with journalctl or traditional log files in /var/log/


## 1. Understanding Linux Services

* A service in linux is a program that continuously runs in the backgorund to handle specific tasks or requests. These are also called daemons.

* We often see the services in linux that ends with `d`(daemons).

**Common linux services:**

`sshd`: Handles Secure Shell(SSH) remote connections

`nginx`: used as Web server, reverse proxy/load balancer

`apache2` or `httpd`: used as web server

`mysqld`: MySQL database server

`cron`: Schedular for periodic tasks

`networking`: Handles networking setup

`ufw/ firewalld`: Handles firewall services

`docker`: used for container engine to run containers


## 2. Systemd Basics

* systemd is the init system or service manager used in most modern linux distributions. It is the main program that starts when we boot the system.

* When we check the processes that are running te PID = 1 will be always the systemd. This process is started by the kernel.

* There are few things to take into consideration:
 **Units:**
   * Everything in systemd is a unit. Everything that is managed in systemd is unit. Every file in systemd is unit that tells it how to manage something.
  
   * This files(units) types in systemd are:
     âœ… `.service`: Defines a background service (daemon). This unit keeps information about services. which service to run? when to run? is this service requires another service to run?

     âœ… `.socket`: It waits for connection request coming from TCP port or unix socket. When it finds connection then it connects with .service file for that service. 
     > ðŸ§  Example: docker.socket listens on a Unix socket and starts docker.service only when needed.
     
     âœ… `.target`:  This unit is created for grouping multiple services. When we want to run one srvice and that service requires another services also, target file group that services.
     > ðŸ§  Example: multi-user.target = networking + login + system services (no GUI).
     
     âœ… `.mount`: This unit is used to automatically mount thte system. It tells systemd where to mount the drive, when to mount it?
     > ðŸ§  Example: You want to mount a network folder (NFS or SMB) every time the system boots â€” use a .mount unit.
     
     âœ… `.timer`: This unit tells systemd when to run a `.service` file.
     > ðŸ§  Example: As i set cron job to run at 3AM.
     >
**Dependencies:**
 * In systemd, dependencies define how and when one unit depends on another.
     * You want to start Service A, but it relies on Service B to be running first.
  Thatâ€™s where Requires=, Wants=, After=, and Before= come in.
