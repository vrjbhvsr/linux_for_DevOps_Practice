## Basic of Process üå±

### What is Process?
* When we run any program or any command , it becomes a process. In other words, a process is a running instance of a program.
* To check the process in current terminal we simply write command `ps`.

```bash
ps
```

**Here,**
* `PID` : Process ID
  
* `TTY`: Terminal (Teletypewriter) associated with the process, e.g., `pts/0`

* `TIME` : total CPU time the process has used

* `CMD` : Command name(what was run)


The command with flags shows the detailed information of process. 
> *For example*,
> **UID(UserID)** : Who is the owner of the process,
> **PPID(Parent process ID)**: The process started another process,
> **C**: CPU usage,
> **STIME**: start time,
> **TIME**: total time.

```bash
ps -ef
# or
ps -e -f
```

**Flags**

* `-e` shows all the processes not just in currrent terminal

* `-f ` shows full listed information.

### Process States

All the process has it state, meaning whether the process is running, terminated, sleeping, or dead, and it is represented by single letter.

State | Description
------|-------------
R     | Runnning(on CPU)
S| Sleeping(Waiting for an event)
D| Uninterruptible sleep
T|Stopped
Z|Zombie(terminated but not reaped)
X| Dead (shouldn't be seen normally)

**There can be additional flags are appended on main state letter**

Flag  | Description
------|-------------
< | High prirority process
N| Less prority
L| process pages are locked into RAM.(No swaping of memory from RAM to Disk)
s| A session leader(Usually a shell or service)
l| Multi-threaded
+| In the foreground process group
I| Ideal kernel thread

**To check the process status we use `ps aux`.**
```bash

ps aux

```

### Foregrouind vs Background Process
* Foground process: This process directly runs into terminal and it blocks the terminal or shell until it finishes the process.

  > For example, `top` command is used to see the process currently running(real-time), it is a foreground process.

* Background Process: This process runs in the background and don't block the terminal while being in the process. It ends silently unless we monitor.

  > The cron job that I set for backing up everyday at 3 am is background process.
```bash
# foreground process is any command we run in shell

top

# To make any process run in background we use

command &

```

### Daemon processes

* This processes are long-running background services. It does not have any controlling terminal.

  > The cron job is a daemon process.

```bash

# To see running daemons:

ps -ef |grep daemon

```

### Another usefull commands:

```bash
top                # Real-time view of processes
```

```bash
htop                # Better Visual version of top
```

```bash
pidof                # Get PID o the programm
```

```bash
pgrep                # Searches processes by name
```



## Starting and Controlling Process

### Running Programs

* To run a compiled program or script in the foreground:
  
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Basic Run:

```bash
./program-script
```

* To run a compiled program or script in the Background:

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Background Run:

```bash
./program-script &
```

### Controlling Foreground and Background jobs

üìå `jobs`: Shows the background jobs for current terminal.

```bash
jobs
```

üìå `fg`: Bring background job to the foreground

```bash
fg %10      # Here, % is show it's a job number not processID
```

üìå `bg`: Resumes a suspended job in the background.

```bash
bg %10
```

### Suspending job

üìå `ctrl + z`

    * The job we want to stop or suspend can be done by  `ctrl+z` command. When we again want to continue we just have to write `bg`
 or `fg`.

 ### üõ°Ô∏è Run Programs That Survive Logout

If we want to logout and process is running background we can still do it without terminating the process by `nohup` command. The process continues even after log out and saved to `nohup.out` once finished.

 ```bash
nohup ./program &
```

üìå `disown`

If we use disown the job than it will be removed from the jobs table. The shell will forget this job and won't keep track of that job. When you log out it might get killed.

```bash
disown %10
```

So, After disowning the job shell forgets the job id and we won;t be able to conitnue job later. it's gone completely. But we might able to get the process Id using `pgrep`, `top`, `pidof`.
