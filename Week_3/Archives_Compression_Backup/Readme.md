# ðŸ“‚ Archives, Compression, and Backup

## Archives:
* When we are working with **large number of files**, there might be necessity to **transfer/move files** from one place to another.
* Moving too many individual files togather is **not a good practice** and that's where **archiving** comes into picture.
* Archiving, in easy words, means **bundling multiple files** together into a **single file**.

> **Example:**
> Suppose we have file1, file2, file3, and file4, and we want to move or transfer them. We can create a bundle of these files and turn them into one archive file, like files.tar.

## ðŸ›  Learning tar â€” the king of archiving on Linux

Tar stands for Tape Archive.

### Commands for creating, extracting and viewing a tar file:

```bash
# To create a tar file

tar -cvf archive_name.tar folder_name/
```

**Here, -flags:**

* `c` means create
  
* `v` means verbose to show the progress
  
* `f` means file

```bash
# To view the tar file content

tar -tvf archive_name.tar
```

**Here, -flags:**

* `-t` means list contents

```bash
# To extract the tar file content

tar -xvf archive_name.tar
```

**Here, -flags:**

* `-x` means extract contents

## Compression

* When we create an archive of large files, we might face storage issues in the future due to the large size of the archive.

* Additionally, transferring a bundle of large files can slow down the process, making file transfer inefficient.

* To overcome these issues, we need to compress the archive file, which reduces the size of the file and allows us to utilize storage space more efficiently.

>Example:
>
>If we have a large archive like files.tar, we can use compression tools (like gzip or bzip2) to reduce the size of the file, turning it into a more manageable size such as files.tar.gz.


## ðŸ›  Adding Compression to tar

Compressing means reducing the size of the tar file and save the space.

```bash
# To create a zip of tar file

tar -czvf archive_name.tar.gz folder_name/
```

**Here, -flag**

`-z` means using gzip for compression

![screenshot](https://github.com/vrjbhvsr/linux_for_DevOps_Practice/blob/main/Week_3/Screenshots/tarcx.png)

```bash
# To extract a zip of tar file

tar -xzvf archive_name.tar.gz
```

### Compression using bzip2

This works the same way as gzip but gives better compression.

```bash
# To create a zip of tar file

tar -cjvf archive_name.tar.bz2 folder_name/
```
![screenshot](https://github.com/vrjbhvsr/linux_for_DevOps_Practice/blob/main/Week_3/Screenshots/bzip2.png)


**Here, -flag**

`-j` means using bzip2 for compression



```bash
# To extract a zip of tar file

tar -xjvf archive_name.tar.bz2
```
