## 💡Applications
```
- Servers
- Cloud Computing
- DevOps tools (Docker, kubernetes)
- Android phones
- IoT devices
- Routers
- Super-Computers
```

## ⁉️Why do we need linux for DevOps⁉️
* We can deploy our code on linux servers.
* Almost every cloud environment uses linux(ubuntu, debian).
* Almost all DevOps tool runs on linux.


## 🌋Kernel, Bootloader, Shell
### 1️⃣Kernel
* The core of the linux that talks to the computer's hardware.
* It controls the CPU, memory, storage, and devices.
* It manages systems reources.
* It act as a bridge between hardware and software.
### 2️⃣Bootloader
* The thing that wakesup the system and loads the OS.
* After you power on your PC, the bootloader loads the kernel into memory, initializes low level hardware.

**Examples:** `GRUB`, `LILO`

### 3️⃣Shell
* The user interface to the OS.
* The Command-line interface(CLI) that let's you talk to the OS
* It translates the commands into something that kernel can understand.
* It runs your command, scripts, or programs.
* **Examples:** `bash`, `Zsh`, `Fish`

## 💻Desktop Environment
* A desktop environment is a collection of software and graphical components that provides a complete user interface for linux.
