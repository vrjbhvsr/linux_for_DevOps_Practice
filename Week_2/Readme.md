# üêß Linux User Account Management üîê
Before creating or managing users in Linux, it's super important to understand what users are and how switching between them works.

## üë• What are users in Linux?
Users, in Linux, are accounts that can access and operate system.
> **Each users has,**
>  * A username
>  * A home directory
>  * A unique user ID(id)
>  * Specific permissionS and ownships

## üîÑ Switching Between Users
We can switch between two users using two commands.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ su - Substitute User**
```bash
su - username
```
 ‚úÖ This command will switch from current user to given username but before that it will ask for password for that username.

 ‚úÖ If no username provided, it will switch to root user if its allowed.

>  *üí° It is important to note that we can temporarily switch to root user because of safety reasons. To switch to root user we can use `su -i` command.*

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ sudo - Superuser Do**
As I am using AWS EC2 instance, I am not a root user. In this case I still have privilage to use root users commands by using `sudo` command. It temporarily grant a user administrative rights.

‚ùå For example, I tried to install vim editor as ubuntu user without using Sudo command and it gave the error message in return.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è To install vim editor by not being a root user:
```bash
sudo apt install vim
```
ü©∫ To check which user are we? we can use the following command
```bash
whoami
```
